/* Challenge 1: Favorite Foods
- Topic: Object Destructuring
1. Edit the faveFoods object so that it contains 
your favorite foods.
2. Destructure the faveFoods object into three consts: 
breakfast, lunch, and supper.
3. Fetch the meals <section> from the DOM.
4. Set the innerHTML content of the meals <section> to a paragraph
that states what your favorite foods are for breakfast, lunch, and supper.
Use a template literal to construct the string.

E.g.
For breakfast, I only like croissants ü•ê. For lunch, I love pasta üçù, 
and for supper I want usually want pizza üçï.
*/


const faveFoods = {
    breakfast: 'croissants ü•ê',
    lunch: 'salad or a sandwich ü•ô',
    supper: 'noodles or soup üçú'
}


// AS INSTRUCTED
const mealsSection = document.getElementById('meals')
const brekky = faveFoods.breakfast
const lunch = faveFoods.lunch
const supper = faveFoods.supper

mealsSection.textContent = `
    For breakfast, I only like ${brekky}. For lunch, I love ${lunch}, and for supper I usually want ${supper}.
`

// MORE EFFICIENT
/*
document.getElementById('meals').textContent = 
    `
    For breakfast, I only like ${faveFoods.breakfast}.
    For lunch, I love ${faveFoods.lunch}, and for supper 
    I usually want ${faveFoods.supper}.
